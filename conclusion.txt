Conclusion:
- In this project, we applied the complete machine learning workflow to predict house prices using regression techniques. The process included data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. Multiple regression models were built and evaluated to compare their performance and accuracy.
- Based on the evaluation results, the most effective model was identified, and feature importance analysis helped us understand which house attributes have the greatest impact on price prediction. Overall, this study demonstrates how regression models, combined with proper data preprocessing and analysis, can be effectively used to make accurate and reliable predictions in real-world scenarios.
